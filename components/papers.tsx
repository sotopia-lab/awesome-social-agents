To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals{'} demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals{'} personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system.\",\n    environments={text, mixed_objectives},\n    agents={two_agents, finetuning},\n    evaluation={human, rule_based},\n    other={human_agent}\n}",

Our study with players from the Diplomacy community gathers 17,289 messages annotated by the sender for their intended truthfulness and by the receiver for their perceived truthfulness. Unlike existing datasets, this captures deception in long-lasting relationships, where the interlocutors strategically combine truth with lies to advance objectives. A model that uses power dynamics and conversational contexts can predict when a lie occurs nearly as well as human players.\",\n    environments={text, mixed_objectives},\n    agents={more_than_three_agents},\n    evaluation={model_based},\n    other={human_agent}\n}",

We create a gameplay dataset consisting of nearly 900 games, with a total of 7,000 players, 800,000 dialogue turns, 500,000 dice rolls, and 58 million words. We automatically annotate the data with partial state information about the game play. We train a large language model (LM) to generate the next game turn, conditioning it on different information. The LM can respond as a particular character or as the player who runs the game{---}i.e., the Dungeon Master (DM). It is trained to produce dialogue that is either in-character (roleplaying in the fictional world) or out-of-character (discussing rules or strategy). We perform a human evaluation to determine what factors make the generated output plausible and interesting. We further perform an automatic evaluation to determine how well the model can predict the game state given the history and examine how well tracking the game state improves its ability to produce plausible conversational output.\",\n    environments={text, implicit_objectives},\n    agents={more_than_three_agents, pretraining, finetuning},\n    evaluation={human, rule_based},\n    other={human_agent}\n}",

Our approach is to decompose and model these interactions into (1) the DM{'}s intent to guide players toward a given goal; (2) the DM{'}s guidance utterance to the players expressing this intent; and (3) a theory-of-mind (ToM) model that anticipates the players{'} reaction to the guidance one turn into the future. We develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method for training a DM that generates guidance for players by rewarding utterances where the intent matches the ToM-anticipated player actions. Human and automated evaluations show that a DM trained to explicitly model intents and incorporate ToM of the players using RL generates better-quality guidance that is 3x more likely to fulfill the DM{'}s intent than a vanilla natural language generation (NLG) approach.\",\n    environments={text, implicit_objectives},\n    agents={more_than_three_agents, reinforcement_learning},\n    evaluation={human, rule_based},\n    other={human_agent}\n}",

Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) that have access to state information can generate higher quality game turns than LLMs that use dialog history alone. However, previous work used game state information that was heuristically created and was not a true gold standard game state. We present FIREBALL, a large dataset containing nearly 25,000 unique sessions from real D{\\&}D gameplay on Discord with true game state info. We recorded game play sessions of players who used the Avrae bot, which was developed to aid people in playing D{\\&}D online, capturing language, game commands and underlying game state information. We demonstrate that FIREBALL can improve natural language generation (NLG) by using Avrae state information, improving both automated metrics and human judgments of quality. Additionally, we show that LLMs can generate executable Avrae commands, particularly after finetuning.\",\n    environments={text, implicit_objectives},\n    agents={more_than_three_agents, finetuning},\n    evaluation={human, rule_based},\n    other={human_agent}\n}",

Making comparisons between navigation algorithms is challenging because of the effort involved in building these systems and the diversity of platforms used by the community; nonetheless, evaluation is critical to understanding progress in the field. In a step towards reproducible evaluation of social navigation algorithms, we propose the Social Environment for Autonomous Navigation (SEAN). SEAN is a high visual fidelity, open source, and extensible social navigation simulation platform which includes a toolkit for evaluation of navigation algorithms. We demonstrate SEAN and its evaluation toolkit in two environments with dynamic pedestrians and using two different robots.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction},\npages = {281\u2013283},\nnumpages = {3},\nkeywords = {social robot navigation, human-robot interaction},\nlocation = {Virtual Event, USA},\nseries = {HAI '20},\nenvironments={mixed_objectives, embodied},\nagents={reinforcement_learning},\nevaluation={rule_based},\nother={human_agent, simulated_humans}\n}",

Motivated by the fact that Human\u2013Robot Interaction (HRI) shares many participant practices with HCI, we explored whether this trend is mirrored in our field. By producing a dataset covering participant gender representation in all 684 full papers published at the HRI conference from 2006\u20132021, we identify current trends in HRI research participation. We find an over-representation of men in research participants to date, as well as inconsistent and/or incomplete gender reporting, which typically engages in a binary treatment of gender at odds with published best practice guidelines. We further examine if and how participant gender has been considered in user studies to date, in-line with current discourse surrounding the importance and/or potential risks of gender based analyses. Finally, we complement this with a survey of HRI researchers to examine correlations between who is doing with the who is taking part, to further reflect on factors which seemingly influence gender bias in research participation across different sub-fields of HRI. Through our analysis, we identify areas for improvement, but also reason for optimism, and derive some practical suggestions for HRI researchers going forward.},\n    journal = {J.

However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90{\\%} of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.},\n\tauthor = {Wang, Zhe and Veli{\\v c}kovi{\\'c}, Petar and Hennes, Daniel and Toma{\\v s}ev, Nenad and Prince, Laurel and Kaisers, Michael and Bachrach, Yoram and Elie, Romuald and Wenliang, Li Kevin and Piccinini, Federico and Spearman, William and Graham, Ian and Connor, Jerome and Yang, Yi and Recasens, Adri{\\`a} and Khan, Mina and Beauguerlange, Nathalie and Sprechmann, Pablo and Moreno, Pol and Heess, Nicolas and Bowling, Michael and Hassabis, Demis and Tuyls, Karl},\n\tdate = {2024/03/19},\n\tdate-added = {2024-04-19 16:43:21 -0400},\n\tdate-modified = {2024-04-19 16:43:21 -0400},\n\tdoi = {10.1038/s41467-024-45965-x},\n\tid = {Wang2024},\n\tisbn = {2041-1723},\n\tjournal = {Nature Communications},\n\tnumber = {1},\n\tpages = {1906},\n\ttitle = {TacticAI: an AI assistant for football tactics},\n\turl = {https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45965-x},\n\tvolume = {15},\n\tyear = {2024},\n  month={3},\n  environments = {virtual, collaboration, competition, mixed_objectives},\n  agents = {reinforcement_learning, agent_teams},\n  evaluation = {rule_based},\n  other = {n/a},\n\tbdsk-url-1 = {https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45965-x}\n}",

To optimize specific goals such as maximizing revenue and return on investment (ROI) led by ad placements, advertisers not only need to estimate the relevance between the ads and user's interests, but most importantly require a strategic response with respect to other advertisers bidding in the market. In this paper, we formulate bidding optimization with multi-agent reinforcement learning. To deal with a large number of advertisers, we propose a clustering method and assign each cluster with a strategic bidding agent. A practical Distributed Coordinated Multi-Agent Bidding (DCMAB) has been proposed and implemented to balance the tradeoff between the competition and cooperation among advertisers. The empirical study on our industry-scaled real-world data has demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods. Our results show cluster-based bidding would largely outperform single-agent and bandit approaches, and the coordinated bidding achieves better overall objectives than purely self-interested bidding agents.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management},\n  pages = {2193\u20132201},\n  numpages = {9},\n  month = oct,\n  environments = {competition, virtual},\n  agents = {reinforcement_learning, more_than_three_agents},\n  evaluation = {rule_based},\n  other = {n/a}\n}",

However, while most approaches randomly mask tokens, there is strong intuition that deciding what to mask can substantially improve learning outcomes. We investigate this in continued pretraining setting in which pretrained models continue to pretrain on domain-specific data before performing some downstream task. We introduce Difference-Masking, a masking strategy that automatically chooses what to mask during continued pretraining by considering what makes a task domain different from the pretraining domain. Empirically, we find that Difference-Masking outperforms baselines on continued pretraining settings across four diverse language-only and multimodal video tasks.\",\n    environments = {text, virtual},\n    agents = {pretraining, finetuning},\n    evaluation = {model_based},\n    other = {n/a},\n}",

Existing evaluation metrics aim to automate offline user evaluation and approximate human judgment of pre-curated dialogs. However, they are limited in their ability to capture subjective perceptions of users who actually interact with the chatbots and might not generalize to real-world settings. To address this limitation, we propose an approach to approximate online human evaluation, leveraging large language models (LLMs) from the GPT-family. We introduce a new Dialog system Evaluation framework based on Prompting (DEP), which enables a fully automatic evaluation pipeline that replicates live user studies and achieves an impressive correlation with human judgment (up to Pearson r=0.95 on a system level). The DEP approach involves collecting synthetic chat logs of evaluated bots with an LLM in the other-play setting, where the LLM is carefully conditioned to follow a specific scenario. We further explore different prompting approaches to produce evaluation scores with the same LLM. The best-performing prompts, which contain few-shot demonstrations and instructions, show outstanding performance on the tested dataset and demonstrate the ability to generalize to other dialog corpora.\",\n      environments = {mixed_objectives, text},\n      agents = {prompting_and_in_context_learning, two_agents},\n      evaluation = {model_based},\n      other = {n/a}\n}",

However, current evaluation metrics consider only surface features or utterance-level semantics, without explicitly considering the fine-grained topic transition dynamics of dialogue flows. Here, we first consider that the graph structure constituted with topics in a dialogue can accurately depict the underlying communication logic, which is a more natural way to produce persuasive metrics. Capitalized on the topic-level dialogue graph, we propose a new evaluation metric GRADE, which stands for Graph-enhanced Representations for Automatic Dialogue Evaluation. Specifically, GRADE incorporates both coarse-grained utterance-level contextualized representations and fine-grained topic-level graph representations to evaluate dialogue coherence. The graph representations are obtained by reasoning over topic-level dialogue graphs enhanced with the evidence from a commonsense graph, including k-hop neighboring representations and hop-attention weights. Experimental results show that our GRADE significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art metrics on measuring diverse dialogue models in terms of the Pearson and Spearman correlations with human judgments. Besides, we release a new large-scale human evaluation benchmark to facilitate future research on automatic metrics.\",\n      environments = {text},\n      agents = {n/a},\n      evaluation = {human, model_based},\n      other = {n/a}\n}",

The recent introduction of benchmarks raises the question of how best to train and evaluate models for this multi-turn, multi-agent, long-horizon task. This paper contributes to that conversation, by arguing that imitation learning (IL) and related low-level metrics are actually misleading and do not align with the goals of embodied dialogue research and may hinder progress. We provide empirical comparisons of metrics, analysis of three models, and make suggestions for how the field might best progress. First, we observe that models trained with IL take spurious actions during evaluation. Second, we find that existing models fail to ground query utterances, which are essential for task completion. Third, we argue evaluation should focus on higher-level semantic goals. We will release code to additionally filter the data and benchmark models for improved evaluation.\",\n  environments={mixed_objectives, collaboration, embodied},\n  agents={agents_with_memory},\n  evaluation={qualitative, human, rule_based},\n  other={n/a}\n}",

Such disparate evaluations make it difficult to compare the performance of such methods across the literature. To bridge this gap, we introduce SocNavBench, a simulation framework for evaluating social navigation algorithms. SocNavBench comprises a simulator with photo-realistic capabilities and curated social navigation scenarios grounded in real-world pedestrian data. We also provide an implementation of a suite of metrics to quantify the performance of navigation algorithms on these scenarios. Altogether, SocNavBench provides a test framework for evaluating disparate social navigation methods in a consistent and interpretable manner. To illustrate its use, we demonstrate testing three existing social navigation methods and a baseline method on SocNavBench, showing how the suite of metrics helps infer their performance trade-offs. Our code is open-source, allowing the addition of new scenarios and metrics by the community to help evolve SocNavBench to reflect advancements in our understanding of social navigation.},\njournal = {J.

Our agent must be robust to handle such situations well. However, if we cannot rely on the average training or validation reward as a metric, then how can we effectively evaluate robustness? We take inspiration from the practice of unit testing in software engineering. Specifically, we suggest that when designing AI agents that collaborate with humans, designers should search for potential edge cases in possible partner behavior and possible states encountered, and write tests which check that the behavior of the agent in these edge cases is reasonable. We apply this methodology to build a suite of unit tests for the Overcooked-AI environment, and use this test suite to evaluate three proposals for improving robustness. We find that the test suite provides significant insight into the effects of these proposals that were generally not revealed by looking solely at the average validation reward.

With advances in human action recognition, researchers have begun to address the automated recognition of these human\u2013human interactions from video. The main challenges stem from dealing with the considerable variation in recording setting, the appearance of the people depicted and the coordinated performance of their interaction. This survey provides a summary of these challenges and datasets to address these, followed by an in-depth discussion of relevant vision-based recognition and detection methods. We focus on recent, promising work based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, we outline directions to overcome the limitations of the current state-of-the-art to analyze and, eventually, understand social human actions.},\n  month = {11},\n  environments = {collaboration, competition, mixed_objectives, implicit_objectives, embodied},\n  agents = {two_agents, more_than_three_agents, agent_teams},\n  evaluation = {human, rule_based, model_based},\n  other = {human_agent}\n}",

The development of AI curricula that shows people how AI works and what they can do with it is a powerful way to prepare everyone, and especially young learners, for an increasingly AI-driven world. Educators often employ robotic toolkits in the classroom to boost engagement and learning. However, these platforms are generally unsuitable for young learners and learners without programming expertise. Moreover, these platforms often serve as either programmable artifacts or pedagogical agents, rarely capitalizing on the opportunity to support students in both capacities. We designed Doodlebot, a mobile social robot for hands-on AI education to address these gaps. Doodlebot is an effective tool for exploring AI with grade school (K-12) students, promoting their understanding of AI concepts such as perception, representation, reasoning and generation. We begin by elaborating Doodlebot's design, highlighting its reliability, user-friendliness, and versatility. Then, we demonstrate Doodlebot's versatility through example curricula about AI character design, autonomous robotics, and generative AI accessible to young learners. Finally, we share the results of a preliminary user study with elementary school youth where we found that the physical Doodlebot platform was as effective and user-friendly as the virtual version. This work offers insights into designing interactive educational robots that can inform future AI curricula and tools.},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2024 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction},\n  pages = {772\u2013780},\n  numpages = {9},\n  keywords = {collaboration, creativity, education, social robots},\n  location = {<conf-loc>, <city>Boulder</city>, <state>CO</state>, <country>USA</country>, </conf-loc>},\n  series = {HRI '24},\n  environments = {mixed_objectives, virtual, robotics},\n  agents = {more_than_three_agents},\n  evaluation = {human, rule_based},\n  other = {education, more_omniscient}\n}",

Children aged 5-11 years played the video game, which involved assembling contraptions to escape a digital world, and the robot Jibo acted as a collaborative peer that offered questions, reflective prompts, challenges, and ideas. In order to evaluate the role of the robot\u2019s co-presence and creativity scaffolding, we ran a 2x2 experiment to determine the factorial efficacy of the robot\u2019s embodiment and creativity scaffolding behaviors. We observed mixed results, with the robot\u2019s creativity scaffolding having a positive influence on the time taken to complete the game, but not on the overall use of novel objects or reuse of objects.
