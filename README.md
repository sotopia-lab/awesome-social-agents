<!-- The integration of AI systems into our daily lives has become increasingly ubiquitous, with these systems now capable of interacting with humans in more human-like behaviors than ever before. Specifically, t -->
The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)/foundational models presents new opportunities for simulating complex human **social behaviors**. As a result, there is a rapidly growing body of work emerging in this domain. We hope to categorize and synergize recent efforts to provide a comprehensive guidebook of **social agents** weaving together multiple domains, including language, embodiment, and robotics. 

Our goal is to offer insights crucial for understanding and harnessing **social agents'** potential impact on society. We strive to keep these updated regularly and continuously. **We greatly appreciate any contributions via PRs, issues, emails, or other methods.** 

📝 *We are currently working on a survey paper related to content of this repository. Stay tuned for updates!*

# Taxonomy
## Social interaction types
*The objectives of different agents*
### Pure collaboration
*The objectives are shared among agents*

### Pure Competition
*The objectives are zero-sum*

### Mixed Objectives
*Agents’ have different goals, but they are not zero-sum*

### Implicit Objectives
*Goals are not expressed explicitly*

## Number  of agents
### Two agents
### More than three agents

## Social interaction environments
### Closed simulation
*A fixed hand-crafted world*

### Open simulation
*Procedurally expanded or naturally large env*

### Real physical world
* Indoor scenes
* Outdoor scenes


## Communication protocol
### Non-human-like (?) communication
*Centralized control instead of modeling each agent on their own*

### Text Communication
### Voice Communication
### Non-verbal communication

## Modeling Techniques
### Prompting
### In-context learning
### Fine-tuning
### Reinforcement learning

## Human involvement
### No human involvement
### Simulated humans
### Human-in-loop

## Evaluation Protocol
### Rule-based evaluation
### Human evaluation
### Model-based evaluation

## Smaller categories
### Non-turn-based social interaction
