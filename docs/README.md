<!-- The integration of AI systems into our daily lives has become increasingly ubiquitous, with these systems now capable of interacting with humans in more human-like behaviors than ever before. Specifically, t -->
<!-- üéØ What is a **social agent**: A social agent is a human communicative agent that perceive environment, either social or physical, and act upon it with language, action, or non-verbal communication. -->

*For the best experience, we recommend reading this document on the [website](https://sotopia-lab.github.io/awesome-social-agents/).*

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)/foundational models presents new opportunities for simulating complex human **social behaviors**. As a result, there is a rapidly growing body of work emerging in this domain. We hope to categorize and synergize recent efforts to provide a comprehensive guidebook of **social agents** weaving together multiple domains, including language, embodiment, and robotics. 

Our goal is to offer insights crucial for understanding and harnessing **social agents'** potential impact on society. We strive to keep these updated regularly and continuously. **We greatly appreciate any contributions via PRs, issues, emails, or other methods.**

> [!NOTE]
> * **Agent** and **Environment** (Sutton and Barto 2018): An agent is a goal-driven decision-maker that sense and act upon the state of the environment. An environment comprises the state outside the agent, including the other agents if any. 
> * **Social Agent**: An agent that interacts with a multi-agent environment.
> * **Socially Intelligent Agent**: A social agent that interacts and communicates with other agents in a human-interpretable way.

> <li>To understand whether an entity is a (social) agent, we have to situate it in an environment. It is not possible to discuss an agent outside of an environment. </li>
